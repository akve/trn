	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>By joining &nbsp; the TrustReviewNetwork.com (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;TRN&rdquo;) you agree to the following:</p>
	<p>FOR SHOPPERS:</p>
	<p>1) TRN sends email offers for free or discounted products, and or TRN members may visit <a href="http://www.trustreviewnetwork.com">www.trustreviewnetwork.com</a> to see available offers that TRN clients - Amazon Sellers - are seeking unbiased product reviews for, and TRN members agree to leave honest reviews for product they get on www.trustreviewnetwork.com.</p>
	<p>2) You can auto-unsubscribe from TRN at any time using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of all emails you will receive or by logging into your TRN account. You can auto-unsubscribe from the TRN SMS announcements and updates by replying STOP to any SMS you receive from TRN.</p>
	<p>3) Each offer has a limited number of products available from our clients and there is no guarantee that you will get a product. TRN has many more members than it has for any given product. Products are given on a first-come-first-get respond basis.</p>
	<p>4) Products deals offered to you will be available on e-commerce websites such as Amazon.com using a coupon code your received from TRN. The coupon code provided reduces the price shown on the e-commerce site. In most cases you will still be responsible for normal shipping and handling charges. Amazon Prime members get products fulfilled by Amazon shipped free most of the time. &nbsp;TRN makes no representations that shipping and handling charges will be free and members are fully responsible for any and all shipping charges.</p>
	<p>5) The promo codes you receive are for your limited, one-time use. If you are caught sharing your promo codes, you will be permanently removed from The Trust Review Network. We encourage shoppers to invite friends and family to join, but promo codes are NEVER to be shared. &nbsp;6) If you secure a coupon code, that coupon code is good for a maximum of one item, per household.</p>
	<p>6) When you order a product through TRN, you are obligated to review the product on the third party website where you ordered the product within 21 days of receiving the product. Failure to do so may result in the suspension of your account.</p>

	<p>8) You agree that when leaving a product review on Amazon for a product you received thorough a TRN promotion, disclose the fact that your received the item at a discount &nbsp;in exchange for an honest and &nbsp;unbiased review.&nbsp; Your reviews should be at least than 30 words, though 75 words or more is preferred. &nbsp; For further information regarding how to write a review that complies with Amazon&rsquo;s guidelines regarding free or discounted products, please <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/customer-reviews-guidelines">visit this page </a>on Amazon&rsquo;s website.</p>
	<p>9) &nbsp;You agree not to resell the products you received on TRN.&nbsp; Do not resell products you receive from The Trust Review Network.
